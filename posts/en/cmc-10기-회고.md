summary: "Key lessons from working as a Dev PM and Android developer during CMC Season 10 - managing project scope with MOSCOW prioritization, tracking team progress with Kanban boards, building reusable UI components with Custom Views, and improving collaboration efficiency by sharing logic with iOS developers."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Use the MOSCOW method to clearly set feature priorities before starting a project"
  - "Kanban boards are only effective when you ask team members to write detailed entries"
  - "Plan feature-level schedules before development to maintain code quality"
  - "Custom Views should be used proactively for any frequently reused layouts"
  - "Sharing implementation logic with iOS developers expands thinking and improves development efficiency"

My `Central Makeus Challenge` Season 10 journey has come to an end.
It was my first extracurricular activity, and there were many things I wish I had done differently.
Here is my retrospective on what I found regrettable.


## Did I Fulfill My Role as Dev PM?



### 1\. MOSCOW

I found this MOSCOW framework from a GitHub repo I stumbled upon [(original link)](https://cse0518.notion.site/MoSCoW-67cf0e794a9f412fa6a9e4a2eec90fc5) ... If I hadn't used this, things could have gone really wrong! We set priorities together as a team before the project started, and it helped tremendously. (I'll definitely use this in my next project too.)
The one thing I regret is that **we could have written the MOSCOW items more specifically**.



### 2\. Project Kanban Board

Everyone used it well, but as the project progressed and things got busier, entries became rather brief. As Dev PM, I should have **asked the team members to write more detailed entries on the Kanban board**.

Looking back at my self-assessment... I think I actually did pretty well!? (Maybe it just seems that way because I didn't do that much...) The team members were so competent that things ran smoothly... Anyway! Not bad!
(It would have been nice to get feedback from someone with PM experience rather than just doing a self-review, but unfortunately I didn't know anyone...)



## Did I Do Well as an Android Developer?



### 1\. I Was in Too Much of a Rush

Even though the development schedule **had plenty of room**, I **focused solely on feature implementation**.
I didn't put effort into writing good code (non-duplicated, readable by anyone, highly reusable). I don't know what I was so busy with, but I wrote code in too much of a hurry. (I'm currently refactoring the hastily written code...)



**Before starting development, identify the features to implement and set deadlines for each one.** If there's plenty of time left, spend it thinking about code quality. If time is short, focus on feature implementation first!



**Also, use Custom Views more actively.**
Until now, I thought Custom Views should only be used for complex layouts.
However... during the CMC project, I realized that **for layouts that are reused frequently, it's always better to create a Custom View**.

### 2\. Communication with iOS Developers

Even though we use different languages and frameworks, I believe the logic for implementing a feature is essentially the same. I wondered whether it was really necessary to align our logic... but in hindsight, sharing logic would have been beneficial.

1. By understanding each other's thought processes, our perspectives would expand.

2. If one person thinks through the logic ahead of time, the other person doesn't have to figure it out from scratch.

I think that covers everything. Next project, I'll do better based on these reflections...



## So Is It Over???

There's still a lot to do. (Code refactoring, remaining features to implement, addressing feedback from Demo Day, etc.) Fortunately, the team seems willing to keep going... ! Let's push through!
